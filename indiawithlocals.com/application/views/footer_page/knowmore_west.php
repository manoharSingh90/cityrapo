The famous Elephanta caves or the Ajanta-Ellora caves, lets you dig deeper in history and listen to the stories which date back to the ancient period. For a more cosmopolitan experience, do not forget to visit Mumbai, which offers a glimpse into the colonial history of the British, as well as how the cultures of the sea farers just mixed with the rest of the native populations in Mumbai.
