        <p>While Momo’s have been a rage amongst a lot of people from different age groups, North east region has more food options which every foodie should at least try once on their visit to the region. Sometimes the comforting taste which you get in a casual street stall is much better than a glamorous night out or a fine dining experience. The street food culture in North East India has a culture which is unparalleled. What is more interesting to note is the fact that any lane which has the humble carts serving dishes are as colourful and flavoursome as you can think of. They are a true experience of gastronomic kaleidoscope, with abundance of flavours which taste absolute divine.</p>
        <p>There are variations in cuisine according to climatic conditions and the taste of the people there. Manipur is known for its seasonal stews while Meghalaya is known for its fish preparations and its spice additions to meat cooking. Nagaland is famous for its use of Bamboo and pork preparations, while Mizoram prefers subtle flavours in their boiled food. Thanks to the neighbours, the cuisine in North Eastern India has a lot of influence of flavours from Myanmar, China, Tibet, the influence can easily be seen and taste in the cuisine of Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim. The only trait that Tripura shares with the rest of the country is bursting of the masala’s. Do you know what that it?</p>
        <p>The cuisine of Assam ranges from bland to spice, depending on how you would like to have your meal. But rice being the centerpiece of the cuisine. A staple diet for any Assamese would be a bowl of rice and some meat preparations.</p>
        <p>Some of the most famous dishes include, Laksa. The dish was born in Malay islands, but it somehow reached Assam and could never go back. One of the spiciest soupy noodles, the dish is a unique mix of coconut milk, tamarind lots of secret spices and fish paste which not only awakens our minds but also our taste buds. If you travel out of Assam, then you will be able to experience a little brother of Jhaal Muri which originated in West Bengal, but somehow it traveled to Meghalaya. Owing to the settlements of the Bengalis in Meghalaya, this snack is an irresistible one which is a mix of all flavours possibly available.</p>
        <p>In North East, you would find more of small stalls, cooking delicious food, and less of proper places to dining, as the North Eastern people say, food is best tasted when it is cooked from the heart.</p>
