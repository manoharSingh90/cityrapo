        <p>The Central part of India consists of states like Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh. A journey through the heart of India is a full spectrum itself, from the earliest Buddhist caves of Ajanta and Ellora to the splendors of elaborate temple architecture, to dense wildlife sanctuaries which to all nature, wildlife enthusiasts gives the exact adrenaline rush, to a tete-e-tete with the tribals. Get on board and enjoy the authentic flavors of each place with lots of history, heritage, cultures yet to be explored</p>
        <p>The region has a blend of modernity trapped into the traditions which are rooted in time. To go back in history, the Deccan-Peninsular Plateau has a history which can be traced back to the times when Gondwana land broke into fragments, which moved northward with time. One of the oldest landmass of India, it can further be divided into Central Highlands, north of the river Narmada, which forms most of the Malwa Plateau and Deccan Plateau, a triangular landmass which falls below the river Narmada. There are five major river systems which flow through them: Narmada and Tapti in Madhya Pradesh, and Godavari, Bhima and Krishna in Maharashtra, whose sources lie in the western ghats which further run eastwards. It becomes easy to trap all the monsoon rains blowing off the Arabian Sea, as the mountains form a divide between the lush, densely populated coastal lowlands and the more arid lands of the Deccan Plateau.</p>
        <p>The major part of the region is held largely by Madhya Pradesh. They hold enough ancient monuments, wildlife reserves, sacred pilgrimage towns, the thick densely forested remote forests which has a charm of its own. Forays into the Central Indian Sal forests which offer a glimpse of wild tigers, and a rendezvous with the tribals will let you experience the region which has a lot of offer in term of culture. Visit the region, and explore the central part of a diverse subcontinent, rooted in its traditional ways of life, yet outward looking.</p>
        <p>The region offers you tales right from the pre-modern cave hunter gatherers society to up town, forward looking modern cities, which have their cultures intact in them. To trace the spiritual descent of India, the region is pretty equipped as the beautiful temple architecture in Khajuraho lets you peek into the temple architecture, or a visit to Ujjain will give you the spiritual cleansing and the environs to help you understand the spiritual culture of India. Visit Bhimbetka Cave’s which offer a glimpse of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The Stupa’s at Sanchi, one of the World Heritage Site, has been attracting a lot of people. Visit the Stupas, and understand Buddhism as part of the evolving religions in India. The city of Lakes can never be a miss for anyone. How can anyone miss out on a city which has been ever evolving as yet so culturally accumulative? </p>
