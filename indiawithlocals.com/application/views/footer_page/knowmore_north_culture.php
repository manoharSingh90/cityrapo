        <p>Culture is the collective consciousness of a group of people. The composition of culture contains a blend of customs, values, beliefs, life style, heritage and arts (music, painting, dance and handicrafts etc.). The social landscape of the people is determined by the set of beliefs that is formed over time in their culture.</p>
        <p>North India is a blend of several strands of cultures that have either gotten left behind as the legacy of several rulers who passed through this space or those that have developed since the medieval times. The Northern Most tip is a mixed culture of Buddhism, Islam, Shaivism, and Hinduism in Jammu and Kashmir. The state of Punjab carries forward the legacy of the brave warriors which are known as the Punjabis, a culture full of lavish traditions and fun-loving customs. Rajasthan is majorly influenced by the Rajputana and is a mosaic of many languages, dialects, music and dance forms. Uttrakhan is a haven for adventurers, trekkers, canmpers and mountaineers. Uttar Pradesh contains the traditions of one of the oldest city, and the once Mughal Capital Agra. The variegated blend of these distinct states converges into one to give a glimpse of what we know of as the Northern Indian Culture. </p>
        <p>Aryans, Afghans, Mughal and many have passed through this region with dreams of conquest. The culture they left behind still thrives across the region. The saying that Indiaâ€™s diversity thrives in harmony is best seen here in these regions.</p>
		  <p>Jammu and Kashmir has a rich cultural heritage and a fine wealth of language, ancient literature, religion, crafts, arts, and music. Travelling to Kashmir gives you a taste of the deep rooted traditions which are an integral part of the lives of the people.</p>
		  <p>Rajasthan, was once named Rajputana, is the 'Land of The Kings' today. The Rajputana culture that has developed is a fine blend of music, dance, arts, crafts, paintings etc. This land has beautiful sights inspite of having the Thar desert. The Hindustani Classical Music, Shastriya Sangeet are some of the most revered traditions that have come out of it. The folk dances are captivating forms of kalbeliya and ghoomar.</p>
		  <p>Other states of Northern India also offer their unique arts, crafts, music, dance, architecture which has developed with the unique history of the particular state. The diversity is what stands out and captivates the very essence of that region.</p>
