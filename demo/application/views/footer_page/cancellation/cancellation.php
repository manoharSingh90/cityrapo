            <h2>Cancellations by India With Locals</h2>
            <p>We may cancel a walk/ tour at any time prior to departure if, due to terrorism, natural disasters, political instability, or other external events related to host, it is not viable for us to operate the planned itinerary. If we cancel your tour, you can transfer amounts paid to an alternate departure date or, alternatively, receive a full refund. In circumstances where the cancellation is due to external events outside our reasonable control, refunds will be less any unrecoverable costs. We are not responsible for any incidental expenses you may have incurred as a result of your booking, including but not limited to visas, vaccinations, travel insurance, or non-refundable flights or any other reason.</p>
            <h2>Amendments to bookings by the traveller</h2>
            <p>a) If a traveller wishes to amend an existing booking, the original booking must be cancelled and a new booking made. Prices applying to the new booking will be the price at the time the new booking is made. Cancellation charges may apply (refer to Cancellations by the traveller).</p>
            <h2>Amendments to itineraries by India With Locals</h2>
            <p>While we endeavour to operate all tours as described, we reserve the right to change the tour itinerary. The itinerary provided for each host is representative of the activities planned; however, the route, amenities, stops, and modes of transport may be subject to change without prior notice due to local circumstances or events. If we make a major change before departure, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible. We reserve the right to change an itinerary after departure due to local circumstances or events outside of our control.</p>
            <p>No shows are treated as last-minute cancellations and are non-refundable.</p>
